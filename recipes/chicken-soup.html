        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a favorite for hectic nights when we all eat at different times. After adding the chicken and gnocchi, throw it in a slow cooker on the lowest setting so it is ready when you are. Goes well with pesto bread sticks!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large zucchini, diced</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>½ red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, shredded</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 pint fat-free half-and-half</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken meat</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package small gnocchi</li>
            <li>2 cups torn fresh spinach</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground thyme</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter with olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, celery, onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and garlic in the hot butter and oil until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir flour into mixture, coating vegetables; cook 2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir chicken broth into vegetables, stirring until flour paste combines with broth and soup is thick and smooth, about 5 minutes. Pour in both kinds of half-and-half; bring to a simmer. Cook until slightly thickened, about 5 more minutes. Gently fold chicken, gnocchi, and spinach into soup. Season with salt, black pepper, thyme, and nutmeg. Adjust thickness by adding more chicken broth, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Cooking note: </strong>Rotisserie chicken gives the best flavor, but any cooked chicken will do! Leaving out some of the vegetables will make the soup richer and more of a comfort food.</p>
